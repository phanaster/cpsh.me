Welcome to cpshme !

I am new to Ruby on Rails and one day i found the PasswordPusher.
Then an idea came to my mind. Hey , you could make something like this for coupons.
So i started and i am not done yet.

Feel free to criticize my mostly crappy formatted code or make some suggestions.

I also used MongoDB because it felt like this litte WebApp could be a nice start to try it out.
